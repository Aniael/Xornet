# Information
We are XORNET this is a fun little project started by @Geoxor for people who have servers and don’t have shit to do with them , our goal is to let people use our servers for themselves for cheap!

# Reporter
The reporter is the main binary app that you can easily download and install on your VMs or servers, it takes care of reporting system information to http://xornet.cloud and its lightweight!

# BTW
We don't know how to code, if you get hacked, its your fault, go fuck yourself ;)
