# Installation 
Make sure you have Node.js v14+
  1. Client: 
     1. `npm i` to install dependancies
     2. Comment out these lines in vue.config.js
        ```js
        // public: "https://xornet.cloud",
        // https: true,
        // cert: fs.readFileSync("./cert.pem"),
        // key: fs.readFileSync("./key.pem")
        ```
     3. `npm run serve` to run the client
     4. Use firefox because chrome doesn't like storing cookies in localhost
     5. `npm run build` to compile the client
  2. Reporter: 
     1. `npm i` to install dependancies

Theres some scripts you should run before doing pull requests
  `npm run prettify` on each folder to fix the formatting so it matches the rest of the repo
