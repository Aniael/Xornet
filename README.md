# Information
We are XORNET this is a fun little project started by @Geoxor for people who have servers and don’t have shit to do with them , our goal is to let people use our software to manage their servers!

Heres the discord server for you to join

# Reporter
The reporter is the main binary app that you can easily download and install on your VMs or servers, it takes care of reporting system information to http://xornet.cloud and its lightweight!

The compiled binaries work on the following operating systems:
  - Debian
  - Windows 10
  - Windows Server 2019

The reporter can be run using node.js at least on:
  - Debian
  - Ubuntu
  - Manjaro
  - Raspbian
  - Windows 10
  - Windows Server 2019
 
# TODO
- Updater for Reporter (using Electron)
- Figure out why the front-end lags
- Comment the code since people are actually forking the code
  
# Disclaimer
We don't know how to code, if you get hacked, its your fault for not committing.
